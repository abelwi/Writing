        "text": "Some people believe that in order to reduce crimes, prisoners should be given longer prison sentences while some people think there are other alternative ways. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "sampleAnswer":"Crime reduction is a serious issue in modern societies, and people have different opinions on how to deal with criminals. Some believe that increasing the length of prison sentences can effectively reduce crime rates, while others argue that there are more effective alternatives. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion. On the one hand, those who support longer prison sentences argue that it can act as a deterrent for potential criminals. If people know that they will face severe punishment, they may be less likely to commit crimes. Moreover, keeping criminals in prison for longer periods can prevent them from harming society. For example, serious offenders such as murderers and rapists should stay in jail as long as possible to ensure public safety. However, this approach has some drawbacks. Long-term imprisonment can increase the financial burden on governments as they have to spend more money on maintaining prisons. On the other hand, some people believe that alternative methods can be more effective in reducing crime. One such method is rehabilitation programs, which focus on educating and reforming criminals rather than just punishing them. By providing vocational training and psychological support, criminals can reintegrate into society and become law-abiding citizens. Another alternative is community service, which can be beneficial for minor offenders. Instead of keeping them in jail, they can contribute to society in a positive way. In some countries, this approach has shown better results in lowering crime rates compared to long prison sentences. In my opinion, while longer prison sentences may be necessary for dangerous criminals, it is not the best solution for all types of crime. Governments should focus more on preventive measures, such as improving education and creating job opportunities. If people have a stable life and future, they will be less likely to commit crimes in the first place. Therefore, a combination of strict punishment for serious crimes and rehabilitation for minor offenders can be the most effective approach to reducing crime rates."

        "text":"Some people believe that social inequality is an inevitable part of society, while others argue that governments should take active measures to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "sampleAnswer":"Social inequality is a serious problem that exist in many countries. Some people think that this is natural and cannot be avoided, while others believe that the government should take action to narrow the wealth gap. This essay will discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion. On the one hand, some argue that inequality is an unavoidable part of society. They claim that differences in wealth are caused by personal effort, skills, and opportunities. For example, people who work harder and have better education tend to earn more money, while those who lack skills or do not put much effort into work will likely remain poor. Furthermore, many economic systems, especially capitalism, relies on competition and rewards those who are more capable, which can naturally result in a wealth gap. For these reasons, some people believe that inequality is something that cannot be removed completely. On the other hand, many people suggest that governments should take serious measures to reduce the wealth gap. One common method is imposing higher taxes on the rich and using the money to support the poor, such as providing free education and healthcare. This can give low-income people more opportunities to improve their lives and contribute to the economy. In addition, governments can increase the minimum wage and create policies that protect workers' rights, which will make sure that even low-skilled workers can afford a decent living standard. In my opinion, while some level of inequality is natural in society, the government should still make efforts to reduce the extreme wealth gap. If the rich becomes too rich and the poor becomes too poor, it may lead to social problems like crime and instability. Therefore, implementing policies such as progressive taxation and better social welfare can help maintain a more balanced and stable society."

        "text":"Some people believe that when designing a building, the most important thing to be considered is the function rather than the outward appearance. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "sampleAnswer":"When designing a building, some people think that the primary concern should be its function rather than its external look. While I agree that a building should be practical, I believe its outward appearance is also important in many cases. On the one hand, function plays a vital role in architecture. A building should be designed to serve its purpose efficiently, whether it is a hospital, a school, or an office. If the structure is not functional, it could cause inconvenience and even safety hazards for people who use it. For example, a school without enough classrooms or a hospital with poor ventilation may not serve their purpose properly. Therefore, prioritizing function ensures that a building meets the needs of its users. On the other hand, the outward appearance of a building should not be neglected. The visual aspect of a structure can contribute to the beauty of a city and enhance people's experience. If architects only focus on function, cities may become dull and uninspiring. A well-designed building with an attractive appearance can also reflect cultural values and historical significance. For instance, iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or Sydney Opera House are not only functional but also add artistic value to their cities. Thus, appearance is also an important factor to consider. In conclusion, although function should be the priority when designing a building, the outward appearance should not be completely ignored. A balance between practicality and aesthetics is needed to create buildings that are both useful and visually pleasing."

        "text":"Young people are leaving their homes from rural areas to study or work in the cities. What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this development outweigh its disadvantages?",
        "sampleAnswer":"In recent years, young people are increasingly leaving their rural hometowns to pursue education or employment in urban areas. This trend is driven by several reasons, and while it brings certain advantages, it also pose significant drawbacks. One main reason why young people move to cities is the better educational opportunities. Universities and vocational institutions in urban areas offer a wider range of courses and higher quality education, which can help students to gain necessary skills for future careers. Additionally, cities provide more diverse job opportunities, including higher salaries and career advancement, compared to the limited employment options in the countryside. Moreover, the urban lifestyle with modern infrastructure and entertainment options is also an attractive factor for young individuals. However, this trend also has negative impacts. Firstly, it can lead to overpopulation in cities, putting pressure on housing, transportation, and public services. As a result, urban dwellers may face higher living costs and more competition in job markets. Furthermore, when many young people leave their rural homes, those areas can experience a labor shortage, which affects the local economy and agricultural sector. This could lead to the decline of traditional farming and rural industries, making life more difficult for those who remain. In conclusion, while the movement of young people from rural areas to cities provides them with better education and job prospects, it also creates challenges such as urban overcrowding and rural decline. I believe that the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages, but governments should implement policies to support rural communities and balance development between urban and rural areas."
