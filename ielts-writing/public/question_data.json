        "sampleAnswer":"Crime reduction is a serious issue in modern societies, and people have different opinions on how to deal with criminals. Some believe that increasing the length of prison sentences can effectively reduce crime rates, while others argue that there are more effective alternatives. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion. On the one hand, those who support longer prison sentences argue that it can act as a deterrent for potential criminals. If people know that they will face severe punishment, they may be less likely to commit crimes. Moreover, keeping criminals in prison for longer periods can prevent them from harming society. For example, serious offenders such as murderers and rapists should stay in jail as long as possible to ensure public safety. However, this approach has some drawbacks. Long-term imprisonment can increase the financial burden on governments as they have to spend more money on maintaining prisons. On the other hand, some people believe that alternative methods can be more effective in reducing crime. One such method is rehabilitation programs, which focus on educating and reforming criminals rather than just punishing them. By providing vocational training and psychological support, criminals can reintegrate into society and become law-abiding citizens. Another alternative is community service, which can be beneficial for minor offenders. Instead of keeping them in jail, they can contribute to society in a positive way. In some countries, this approach has shown better results in lowering crime rates compared to long prison sentences. In my opinion, while longer prison sentences may be necessary for dangerous criminals, it is not the best solution for all types of crime. Governments should focus more on preventive measures, such as improving education and creating job opportunities. If people have a stable life and future, they will be less likely to commit crimes in the first place. Therefore, a combination of strict punishment for serious crimes and rehabilitation for minor offenders can be the most effective approach to reducing crime rates."

        "text":"Some people believe that social inequality is an inevitable part of society, while others argue that governments should take active measures to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "sampleAnswer":"Social inequality is a serious problem that exist in many countries. Some people think that this is natural and cannot be avoided, while others believe that the government should take action to narrow the wealth gap. This essay will discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion. On the one hand, some argue that inequality is an unavoidable part of society. They claim that differences in wealth are caused by personal effort, skills, and opportunities. For example, people who work harder and have better education tend to earn more money, while those who lack skills or do not put much effort into work will likely remain poor. Furthermore, many economic systems, especially capitalism, relies on competition and rewards those who are more capable, which can naturally result in a wealth gap. For these reasons, some people believe that inequality is something that cannot be removed completely. On the other hand, many people suggest that governments should take serious measures to reduce the wealth gap. One common method is imposing higher taxes on the rich and using the money to support the poor, such as providing free education and healthcare. This can give low-income people more opportunities to improve their lives and contribute to the economy. In addition, governments can increase the minimum wage and create policies that protect workers' rights, which will make sure that even low-skilled workers can afford a decent living standard. In my opinion, while some level of inequality is natural in society, the government should still make efforts to reduce the extreme wealth gap. If the rich becomes too rich and the poor becomes too poor, it may lead to social problems like crime and instability. Therefore, implementing policies such as progressive taxation and better social welfare can help maintain a more balanced and stable society."

        "text":"Some people believe that when designing a building, the most important thing to be considered is the function rather than the outward appearance. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "sampleAnswer":"When designing a building, some people think that the primary concern should be its function rather than its external look. While I agree that a building should be practical, I believe its outward appearance is also important in many cases. On the one hand, function plays a vital role in architecture. A building should be designed to serve its purpose efficiently, whether it is a hospital, a school, or an office. If the structure is not functional, it could cause inconvenience and even safety hazards for people who use it. For example, a school without enough classrooms or a hospital with poor ventilation may not serve their purpose properly. Therefore, prioritizing function ensures that a building meets the needs of its users. On the other hand, the outward appearance of a building should not be neglected. The visual aspect of a structure can contribute to the beauty of a city and enhance people's experience. If architects only focus on function, cities may become dull and uninspiring. A well-designed building with an attractive appearance can also reflect cultural values and historical significance. For instance, iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or Sydney Opera House are not only functional but also add artistic value to their cities. Thus, appearance is also an important factor to consider. In conclusion, although function should be the priority when designing a building, the outward appearance should not be completely ignored. A balance between practicality and aesthetics is needed to create buildings that are both useful and visually pleasing."

        "text":"Young people are leaving their homes from rural areas to study or work in the cities. What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this development outweigh its disadvantages?",
        "sampleAnswer":"In recent years, young people are increasingly leaving their rural hometowns to pursue education or employment in urban areas. This trend is driven by several reasons, and while it brings certain advantages, it also pose significant drawbacks. One main reason why young people move to cities is the better educational opportunities. Universities and vocational institutions in urban areas offer a wider range of courses and higher quality education, which can help students to gain necessary skills for future careers. Additionally, cities provide more diverse job opportunities, including higher salaries and career advancement, compared to the limited employment options in the countryside. Moreover, the urban lifestyle with modern infrastructure and entertainment options is also an attractive factor for young individuals. However, this trend also has negative impacts. Firstly, it can lead to overpopulation in cities, putting pressure on housing, transportation, and public services. As a result, urban dwellers may face higher living costs and more competition in job markets. Furthermore, when many young people leave their rural homes, those areas can experience a labor shortage, which affects the local economy and agricultural sector. This could lead to the decline of traditional farming and rural industries, making life more difficult for those who remain. In conclusion, while the movement of young people from rural areas to cities provides them with better education and job prospects, it also creates challenges such as urban overcrowding and rural decline. I believe that the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages, but governments should implement policies to support rural communities and balance development between urban and rural areas."

        "text":"Some people think that language teaching should take place in small classes, while others believe that the number of students in a language class does not matter. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.",
        "sampleAnswer":"Education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals and societies, and many countries prioritize the education of young people. However, some argue that teaching illiterate adults is even more important and that governments should allocate more funds to this cause. While I agree that adult education is necessary, I believe that prioritizing young people’s education is more beneficial in the long run. One key reason why adult education is essential is that it can improve people’s lives and boost the economy. Many illiterate adults struggle with simple tasks such as reading signs, filling out forms, or understanding important documents. This often leads to difficulties in finding stable jobs, managing finances, or accessing healthcare. If governments invest more in adult literacy programs, these individuals can become more independent and contribute to society. For instance, in some developing countries, literacy programs have allowed adults to secure better jobs, improve their families’ living standards, and participate more actively in their communities. However, prioritizing adult education over young people’s education is not an ideal approach. Children and teenagers represent the future workforce, and providing them with a strong educational foundation ensures long-term national development. If young people do not receive a proper education, the country may face a shortage of skilled workers in fields such as technology, healthcare, and engineering. Furthermore, young people have a higher ability to learn new skills compared to adults, making education more effective at an early age. In conclusion, while adult education is crucial, it should not take priority over the education of young people. Governments should aim to balance funding between these two groups, ensuring that adults receive necessary literacy training while still investing in the next generation’s future. By doing so, they can create a well-educated society with equal opportunities for both young and adult learners."

        "text":"Education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important, and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "sampleAnswer":"Education of young people is a top priority in many countries, but some argue that teaching adults who cannot read or write is even more important. They believe that governments should spend more money on this issue. While I agree that adult education is necessary, I do not think it should be prioritized over young people’s education. One reason why educating adults is important is that it helps them improve their quality of life. Many illiterate adults face difficulties in finding jobs, understanding official documents, or even doing daily tasks like reading signs or paying bills. If governments invest in adult education, these individuals can become more independent and contribute to the economy. For example, in some developing countries, adult literacy programs have helped people get better jobs and escape from poverty. However, focusing too much on adult education may take resources away from young people, who are the future of a country. If children and teenagers do not receive a good education, the country may struggle with a lack of skilled workers in the future. Moreover, young people can learn faster than adults, so it is more efficient to invest in their education early. In my opinion, governments should support both young and adult education, but the main focus should still be on young people. Adult literacy programs are useful, but they should not take too much funding away from schools and universities. The best approach is to balance resources between these two groups to ensure long-term development."

        "text":"Many animal species in the world are becoming extinct nowadays. Some people say that countries and individuals should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "sampleAnswer":"Nowadays, many animal species are becoming extinct due to deforestation, pollution and climate change. Some people believe that we should take action to protect them, while others argue that we should focus more on solving human problems. On the one hand, protecting animals is important for the environment. Every species play a role in keeping the balance of nature. If one species disappear, it can affect the whole ecosystem. For example, when bees are reduced in number, pollination is affected, leading to less crops. Also, some people think that humans have a responsibility to protect animals because we are the main reason for their extinction. If we don’t take action, future generations may never see many species that exist today. On the other hand, some believe that human problems should be prioritized. There are still many people suffering from poverty, diseases and lack of education. The government should invest money in healthcare and education instead of spending on saving animals. For example, in some poor countries, people struggle to have enough food, so protecting wildlife is not their main concern. They think it is more practical to help humans first before taking care of animals. In my opinion, we should protect endangered animals, but not at the cost of ignoring human problems. We can find a balance by taking care of both. For instance, organizations can create jobs for people by involving them in conservation projects. Also, the government can make policies that protect animals without affecting human development. In this way, we can save animals while also improving people’s lives."

        "text":"Fresh water is a limited resource in some parts of the world. Today, increasing demand has made it a global problem. What are the causes of increasing demand, and what measures can governments and individuals take to solve this problem?",
        "sampleAnswer":"Fresh water is essential for life, yet in many parts of the world, it is becoming a scarce resource. As demand continues to rise, it has become a global issue that needs urgent attention. There are several causes behind this increasing demand, but governments and individuals can take steps to address this problem. One major cause is population growth. As the world's population expands, more water is needed for drinking, agriculture, and daily activities. More people mean more water is used for farming, which is the biggest consumer of fresh water. Additionally, industrialization has led to a higher demand for water in factories, energy production, and manufacturing. Many industries use large amounts of water in their processes, often wasting it or polluting it in return. Furthermore, climate change has worsened the problem by reducing rainfall in many regions, leading to droughts and water shortages. To solve this issue, governments should take steps to manage water resources more effectively. They can invest in water conservation projects, such as building reservoirs and improving irrigation systems to reduce waste. Moreover, stricter regulations should be applied to industries to limit water pollution and encourage recycling water in factories. Governments can also educate people about the importance of saving water through campaigns and school programs. Individuals also play an important role in conserving fresh water. Simple actions, such as fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and reducing water waste in daily activities, can make a big difference. People should also be encouraged to reuse water whenever possible, such as using rainwater for gardening instead of clean drinking water. In conclusion, the rising demand for fresh water is mainly due to population growth, industrialization, and climate change. However, with proper management by governments and responsible actions by individuals, we can reduce water waste and ensure a sustainable supply for future generations."

        "text":"Today, there are many tasks at home or work that have been done by robots. Is this a positive or negative development?",
        "sampleAnswer":"In modern society, robots are increasingly used to perform various tasks at home and in the workplace. Some people believe this is a positive development, while others think it has negative consequences. On the one hand, using robots can bring many benefits. First, they help save time and effort. For example, household robots like vacuum cleaners can clean the floor automatically, allowing people to focus on other activities. In the workplace, robots improve efficiency by performing repetitive tasks quickly and accurately, reducing human errors. Moreover, they can work in dangerous environments, such as construction sites or factories, making work safer for humans. On the other hand, relying too much on robots can have some drawbacks. One major concern is job loss. Many workers, especially in manufacturing and customer service, are being replaced by machines, leading to higher unemployment rates. Additionally, robots lack creativity and emotions, which are essential in some fields like education and healthcare. If people depend too much on them, they may lose important skills and become less independent. In my opinion, the increasing use of robots is a positive development, but we should use them wisely. While they can improve efficiency and make life easier, it is important to ensure that they do not completely replace human workers. Governments and companies should find ways to balance technology and employment opportunities so that people can still find meaningful jobs while benefiting from automation."

        "text":"Online shopping is replacing shopping in stores. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?",
        "sampleAnswer":"In recent years, online shopping has become more popular and is gradually replacing traditional shopping in stores. Some people believe this is a positive development, while others think it has negative effects. In my opinion, online shopping has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, online shopping is very convenient. People can buy anything they need without leaving their house. It save time and effort, especially for busy people or those who live far from shopping centers. In addition, online shopping often offer discounts and promotions, which help customers save money. Also, there are more choices available online than in physical stores, allowing people to compare different products easily. On the other hand, online shopping also have some drawbacks. One problem is that customers cannot see or touch the product before buying, which may lead to disappointment if the product is different from what they expect. Also, there are risks of fraud because some online sellers provide fake or low-quality products. Another disadvantage is that online shopping is affecting local businesses. Many small shops are closing because they cannot compete with big online retailers. This can cause job losses and hurt the economy. In conclusion, online shopping has many benefits, but it also comes with challenges. While it makes life easier, people should be careful when buying things online. I believe that both online and offline shopping have their own advantages, and people should choose based on their needs and preferences."

        "text":"Some people think that the increasing use of computers and mobile phones for communication has a negative effect on young people’s reading and writing skills. Do you agree or disagree?",
        "sampleAnswer":"Nowadays, many young people use computers and mobile phones for communication, which some believe has a negative effect on their reading and writing skills. I partly agree with this view because while technology can cause some problems, it also offers benefits for improving literacy skills. On the one hand, too much reliance on digital communication can harm young people's writing abilities. Many use informal language, abbreviations, and emojis when chatting online, which may make them struggle with proper grammar and spelling in academic writing. For example, students often write 'u' instead of 'you' or 'btw' instead of 'by the way', and this habit can affect their formal writing skills. Additionally, reading on social media is often short and superficial, which may reduce young people's ability to focus on long texts and develop deep comprehension skills. On the other hand, technology provides new ways to improve literacy. Many young people read news, articles, and e-books online, which can expand their knowledge. Furthermore, writing blogs, emails, and online discussions allows them to practice expressing their ideas clearly. Some apps even help improve grammar and spelling by giving instant corrections, which can be useful for language learners. In conclusion, the use of computers and mobile phones can have both positive and negative effects on young people's reading and writing skills. While informal digital communication may weaken formal writing, technology also offers many opportunities to improve literacy if used wisely. Therefore, young people should balance their use of technology to get the best results in both reading and writing."

        "text":"Today, advanced science and technology have made great changes to people’s lives, but artists are still highly valued, such as musicians, painters, and writers. What can the arts tell us about life that science and technology cannot?",
        "sampleAnswer":"Science and technology have changed modern life in many ways, making it more convenient and efficient. However, artists, including musicians, painters, and writers, are still highly valued. This is because the arts provide something that science and technology cannot: deep emotional experiences and a better understanding of human life. First, the arts help people express and understand emotions. While science explains how things work, it does not capture feelings like love, sadness, or joy in the way that music, literature, and paintings do. For example, a scientific study may describe how the brain reacts to sadness, but a song or a novel can make people truly feel and connect with it. Through art, people can experience emotions that words alone cannot explain. Second, the arts help preserve culture and history. Science can record facts, but it is the arts that bring history to life. Paintings, music, and stories reflect the values, struggles, and dreams of different societies. For instance, traditional folk songs and ancient paintings tell us about the past in a way that statistics and reports cannot. They allow people to understand their roots and identity. Lastly, the arts inspire creativity and imagination. Science is based on logic and facts, but art allows people to dream and think beyond limits. Many scientific discoveries were inspired by creative ideas first expressed in books or movies. For example, some space technologies today were imagined in science fiction long before they became real. In conclusion, while science and technology improve daily life, the arts provide emotional depth, cultural connection, and creative inspiration. That is why musicians, painters, and writers continue to be highly valued in society."

        "sampleAnswer":"Some people believe that governments should invest in promoting local arts and culture, while others think that spending on international cultural exchanges is more beneficial. Both views have their own advantages, and in my opinion, a balanced approach is the best solution. On the one hand, supporting local arts and culture is important for preserving a country’s identity. Traditional music, dance, and crafts are unique aspects of a nation’s heritage, and without proper funding, they may disappear. Government investment can help artists, museums, and cultural festivals thrive, allowing future generations to learn about their roots. Additionally, promoting local culture can boost tourism, bringing economic benefits to the country. For example, many countries attract visitors through cultural events and historical sites, which generate revenue and create jobs. On the other hand, international cultural exchanges can bring significant benefits. They allow people from different countries to understand and appreciate each other’s traditions, leading to stronger global relationships. Through cultural exchange programs, artists, students, and professionals can share ideas and learn from one another, fostering creativity and innovation. For instance, international film festivals, art exhibitions, and educational exchange programs provide opportunities for cultural diversity and cooperation. Furthermore, exposure to global culture can inspire local artists to create new forms of art by combining traditional and modern influences. In my opinion, both local cultural promotion and international exchanges are necessary. Governments should allocate funds to protect and develop their own cultural heritage while also encouraging international interactions. This approach ensures that local traditions are preserved while also allowing the country to learn and benefit from global cultural influences."

        "text":"Today, TV channels provide more men's sports shows than women's sports shows. Why? Should TV channels give equal time for women's sports and men's sports?",
        "sampleAnswer":"Television channels today broadcast more men’s sports than women’s sports. This is mainly due to differences in popularity, audience interest, and financial factors. However, the question remains: should TV channels provide equal airtime for both? One reason for the dominance of men’s sports on TV is their larger audience. Many men’s sports have a long history and attract more viewers, leading to higher advertising revenue. Broadcasters prioritize profit, so they focus on events that generate more interest. For example, men’s football leagues, such as the English Premier League, have millions of viewers worldwide, while women’s leagues attract fewer audiences. Additionally, sponsors are more willing to invest in men’s sports because of their wider reach, making TV channels prefer broadcasting them. However, some argue that TV channels should give equal time to women's sports to promote gender equality. More exposure could increase interest and support for female athletes, helping to reduce the existing gap. When women’s sports receive more media coverage, sponsorship and investment may also grow, leading to better opportunities for female athletes. For instance, women’s football and basketball have gained popularity in recent years, partly due to increased visibility.In my opinion, while TV channels should not be forced to give equal time, they should take steps to promote women’s sports. A gradual increase in coverage can create a more balanced representation, allowing audiences to develop interest over time. This would ensure fairness while also considering audience demand and business realities."

        "sampleAnswer":"Some people believe that professional athletes should set an example for young people, while others argue that their only responsibility is to perform well in their sport. Both perspectives have valid points, but I believe athletes should strive to be good role models while maintaining their focus on performance. On the one hand, professional athletes have a strong influence on young people. Many children and teenagers admire their skills, dedication, and success. If athletes demonstrate good sportsmanship, discipline, and a healthy lifestyle, they can inspire young people to develop positive habits. For example, athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo or Serena Williams are known not only for their talent but also for their hard work and professionalism. Moreover, many athletes use their fame to support charitable causes, helping to promote social values. On the other hand, some argue that athletes should focus only on their performance rather than being role models. Their primary job is to train, compete, and win. Expecting them to always behave perfectly in public can be unfair, as they are also human and make mistakes. Furthermore, not all athletes have the personal qualities needed to be role models. Some may lack the interest or ability to influence others positively, and forcing them into this role could be unnecessary pressure. In my opinion, while professional athletes should not be forced to be role models, they should still try to set a good example. Since they naturally attract public attention, their behavior can impact young fans. At the same time, their main focus should be on performing well in their sport. A balanced approach—excelling in their career while maintaining positive behavior—would be the best outcome."

        "text":"Many countries believe that international tourism has harmful effects. Why do they think so? What can be done to change their views?",
        "sampleAnswer":"Many countries believe that international tourism has harmful effects for several reasons. Firstly, mass tourism can damage the environment. Popular tourist destinations often suffer from pollution, deforestation, and excessive waste. For example, famous beaches and national parks can become polluted due to irresponsible tourist behavior. Secondly, international tourism can negatively affect local culture. In some places, traditional customs and lifestyles are replaced by commercial activities designed to attract tourists, leading to the loss of cultural identity. Additionally, tourism can cause overcrowding, making life difficult for local residents. Cities like Venice and Barcelona often struggle with too many visitors, leading to higher living costs and housing shortages for locals. To change these negative views, governments and businesses should promote sustainable tourism. First, strict environmental regulations should be enforced to prevent pollution and protect natural areas. Tourists should also be educated on responsible travel, such as reducing plastic waste and respecting local customs. Secondly, local governments can encourage community-based tourism, where tourists experience local culture in a way that benefits local people directly. This can create economic opportunities while preserving traditions. Lastly, limiting the number of visitors in overcrowded places and promoting lesser-known destinations can help distribute tourism benefits more evenly. In conclusion, while international tourism can have harmful effects, these issues can be addressed through better management and sustainable practices. By educating tourists and implementing responsible tourism policies, countries can reduce the negative impacts and appreciate the economic and cultural benefits of global travel."

        "sampleAnswer":"The rise of multinational companies and globalization has led to significant changes in economies and societies worldwide. Some believe these changes benefit everyone, while others argue that they create inequalities. I partly agree with this statement because while globalization and multinational corporations bring many advantages, they also have drawbacks. On the one hand, globalization has boosted economic growth and improved living standards in many countries. Multinational companies create jobs and bring advanced technology, helping to develop industries in developing nations. For example, companies like Apple and Samsung have factories in countries like Vietnam and India, providing employment and training for local workers. Moreover, globalization allows people to access a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, improving their quality of life. On the other hand, globalization and multinational corporations can also create problems. Many large companies prioritize profits over workers’ rights, leading to poor working conditions and low wages, especially in developing countries. For instance, some global brands have been criticized for using sweatshops, where employees work long hours for minimal pay. Additionally, multinational corporations often dominate local businesses, making it harder for small companies to survive. Cultural identity can also be affected, as local traditions and products may be replaced by global brands. In conclusion, globalization and multinational companies bring both positive and negative effects. While they create jobs and improve access to goods and services, they can also harm local businesses and workers. To maximize benefits, governments should regulate these companies to ensure fair wages and protect local industries."

        "sampleAnswer":"In recent years, more people have stopped reading newspapers or watching TV for news, relying instead on the internet. While this shift offers many advantages, it also presents some challenges. In my opinion, the internet as a primary news source is generally positive, but it comes with certain risks that need to be addressed. On the one hand, getting news from the internet is fast and convenient. Unlike newspapers and TV programs, which follow fixed schedules, online news is available anytime and can be updated instantly. This allows people to stay informed about global events in real-time. Additionally, the internet provides access to a wide range of news sources, giving users different perspectives on the same event. Moreover, digital platforms, such as social media and news apps, allow users to engage with content by sharing opinions and discussing issues. On the other hand, relying on the internet for news has some downsides. One major concern is the spread of fake news and misinformation. Unlike traditional media, which follows strict editorial standards, online news can be created and shared by anyone, making it harder to verify facts. Many people believe false information without checking its accuracy. Furthermore, the internet often presents news in short and simplified formats, which can reduce people's ability to analyze complex issues deeply. In conclusion, the shift from newspapers and TV to online news is a positive development because it provides fast and diverse information. However, to fully benefit from it, people need to develop critical thinking skills and verify sources to avoid misinformation."

        "sampleAnswer":"In the digital age, many people turn to social media for news, while others argue that traditional sources like newspapers and television are more reliable. Both perspectives have valid points, but I believe a balanced approach is necessary to ensure accurate and well-rounded information. On the one hand, social media has become a popular news source due to its speed and accessibility. People can instantly access breaking news from different parts of the world, often before traditional media can report on it. Additionally, social media allows users to engage with the news, discuss current events, and receive multiple perspectives. For example, platforms like Twitter and Facebook provide real-time updates from journalists, experts, and ordinary citizens, giving a broader view of an issue. However, the main problem with social media is the spread of misinformation. Since anyone can post content, fake news and biased reporting are common, making it difficult to determine what is true. On the other hand, traditional news sources such as newspapers and television are generally considered more reliable. Professional journalists follow strict fact-checking processes and ethical guidelines before publishing a story. These sources provide in-depth analysis rather than just headlines, helping audiences understand complex issues better.
